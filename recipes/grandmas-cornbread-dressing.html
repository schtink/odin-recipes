        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My grandmother always made this cornbread dressing for holiday dinners and for family gatherings at other times of the year. Use your favorite cornbread mix to make a batch of cornbread, and then crumble it for use in this family-favorite recipe. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!</p>
